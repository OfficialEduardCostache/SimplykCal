## Overview
SimplykCal is a calorie & macro tracker. Unlike most calorie trackers out there, SimplyKcal uses an AI coach named Simply to keep you motivated and answer any related questions regarding nutrition and calories and make real time adjustments to your plan. For exmaple, a user can ask Simply why they feel tired all the time,
Simply will then have a look at the food that they have logged and how many calories they have eaten so far for today and attempt to trouble shoot with the user by perhaps asking more questions or giving a suggestion like "Try and drink more water and if you feel dizzy just rest and don't do any physical activity". It's important
to note that Simply is not a doctor and he can only provide advice, if in any case Simply cannot give accurate advice or he thinks that your situation is dire, he will advise you to see a doctor and provide you with data that can be shown to the doctor as a means to better understand your situation.

SimplykCal is a fun and gamefied take on calorie & macro tracking. Let's be honest, tracking calories and staying on a diet is boring, I am creating this in hopes to make the process more fun and sustainable.
